The problem we'll be tackling is a restaurant recommendation system.

We are given a list of restaurants that contains:

The name of the restaurant.
The percentage of people who recommended the restaurant.
The price range of the restaurant.
The type of food served by the restaurant.

The program will make a recommendation to the user based on this data.

The Problem:
Write a function that has three parameters:

a restaurant file that is open for reading,
the price range (one of $, $$, $$$ and $$$$), and
a list of cuisines.

The function returns a list of restaurants (in that price range, serving at least one of those cuisines), and their ratings sorted from highest to lowest.
